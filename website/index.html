<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
The Fools.  Copyright John Morrice 2010. 
</p>
<p>
The Fools is distributed for educational purposes: it is  intended to be
used by programmers, as an aid in  learning how to write mods for CARPS.
</p>
<p>
The Fools is loosely based on the rules of the Drones RPG: <a
href="http://www.granta.demon.co.uk/drones">www.granta.demon.co.uk/drones</a>/
</p>
<p>
The Drones is Copyright Ian Crowther, Sheila Thomas, Victoria Uren
1995-1996
</p>
<p>
You should familiarise yourself with the rules before play, though note the
following differences  present in Fools:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Your character points are present on the character sheet. These are your
total character points, rather than the points you have not yet spent
available.   Hence you should NOT reduce this value when you spend  a
point.   As in the Fools rules, you should expect  the Game Master to tell
you how many points you have  available before the game begins.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Two additional character attributes are added: Intoxication and
Discomfiture. These attributes are to keep track of the transitory  nature
of drunkenness and being the subject of A Sound  Drubbing, respectively.  
These values range from 0 to -10.  0 indicates  sobreity or perfect health,
while -10 represents a  highly debilated state.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
